# TODO

- Separate screen and virtual screen
- Implement view ratio (Zooming in and out)
- Boid directional characters (maybe use unicode?) (> v < ^)
- Optimize boid mechanisms so it's not iterating all boids 3 times per boid
- Use go concurrency to increase performance
- Bubble tea UI! Help text, border box around rendered screen, etc
- Make this thing a wish app! I want to ssh into boids.internet and get a terminal with boids.
